# Ethan Young

👋 Hi, I'm Ethan Young, a programmer based in Nanjing — and an ordinary person in constant iteration through life.

Over the past ten years of my career, I’ve worn many hats — an engineer who writes code, a son and husband who stands by his family, a friend who listens, and a thinker trying to make sense of life’s underlying logic beyond the terminal.

I’ve long wanted to timestamp the fragments and insights from these roles, but life’s daily threads kept throwing exceptions. This time, I’ve finally hit the “start” button and launched a long-running side project: to document life, share tech, express thoughts, and witness growth.

This blog is deployed on <a className='link link-info' href="https://vercel.com/arferiks-projects">Vercel</a>, reflecting the developer's pursuit of simplicity, efficiency, and elegance — like every line of code pushed to production, built to be clean, stable, and human.

To me, writing is like making one git commit after another — a continuous self-debugging process. It may not refactor the world, but it leaves a meaningful comment in the chaos of the stream.

Great systems are never built overnight. They evolve through version after version. In the same spirit, I’m beginning today — breaking life into small, modular components, and using words to document, reflect, refactor — and engage in a quiet conversation with the world.
